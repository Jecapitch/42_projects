# 42_projects
These are my projects from Campus 19 (42 network Belgium). I attended the piscine in September 2024 and started the cursus in October.
You can e-mail me at jpiscice@student.s19.be.

**Currently included**
- libft : my own library, implementing my own version of libc functions and adding other ones I need as I go on in the cursus.
- ft_printf : my own version of printf, currently working with "sdipucxXbBovV%" converters (v & V for vigesimal base; yes I know but why not?) and all flags "-#0 .+", and potentially ready for any base conversion from 0 to 36 in both lowercase and uppercase with custom converters.
- get_next_line : to read one (get_next_line.c) or several (get_next_line_bonus.c) files line by line.
